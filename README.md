Meet Eliana Walters, a versatile professional fueled by a genuine passion for harnessing technology to optimize business processes and enable data-driven decision-making. My journey has been anything but conventional, showcasing my adaptability and commitment to lifelong learning. With a Bachelor of Arts in English Language and Linguistics from the University of Abuja, I initially honed my organizational and process management skills as an Administrative Manager at Wallyx Allied Services LTD. It was there that my fascination with technology blossomed, leading me to pursue a career in the tech industry, driven by an insatiable curiosity and a desire to make a real difference.

My tech adventure kicked off at SheCodes, where I dove into the world of front-end development. Through hands-on workshops, I gained practical experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, empowering me to create engaging and user-friendly interfaces. A standout moment was my role at Mars, where I designed user requirements for a responsive e-commerce site, leading to a remarkable 40% increase in user engagement within just the first month. This experience solidified my appreciation for user experience principles and their impact on business success.

Understanding the pivotal role of data in shaping effective business strategies, I sought further knowledge through Google’s Data Analytics and Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificates. These certifications, combined with my hands-on experience at Albos Consulting, where my data analysis contributed to a 15% increase in market share and revenue, have equipped me with the skills to extract actionable insights from complex datasets. My proficiency in SQL (MySQL), R, and Python allows me to manipulate and analyze data effectively, while tools like Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, and Google Analytics help me visualize those insights.

Eager to expand my toolkit, I became a proficient functional consultant in Microsoft Power Apps. This role has allowed me to empower organizations to streamline their processes and create innovative solutions without requiring extensive coding knowledge. My expertise in low-code and no-code platforms complements my business analysis skills, enabling me to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders seamlessly. My formal training in Business Analysis and Project Management from Tritek Academy, along with my practical experiences—like managing requirements and reducing project scope creep by 25% at Tiege Consult—have refined my ability to gather requirements, map processes, and develop use cases and user stories. I am well-versed in methodologies such as Agile, Scrum, Waterfall, and Kanban, and utilize tools like Visio, Jira, Balsamic, Lucidchart, Confluence, and BPMN.

I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy embracing new challenges with a positive attitude. My skills in technical writing, presentations, and facilitating process workshops enable me to communicate complex technical concepts to a variety of audiences effectively. I also have experience in conflict resolution and negotiation, which enhances my contributions to team dynamics.

Outside of work, I’m passionate about exploring emerging technologies and staying updated with industry trends. I actively participate in the tech community, driven by a desire to make a meaningful impact in the digital world. I aim to leverage my diverse skill set and analytical mindset to drive innovation and tackle complex business challenges. Ultimately, I aspire to contribute to organizations looking for data-driven solutions, optimized processes, and enhanced user experiences.
